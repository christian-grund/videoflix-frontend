          <h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
          <h3>Liability for content</h3>
          <p>
            The contents of our pages have been created with the utmost care.
            However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and
            timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible
            for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws
            pursuant to § 7 (1) TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we as a
            service provider are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored
            third-party information or to investigate circumstances that
            indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
            information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability
            in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a
            concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware
            of any such infringements, we will remove the content immediately.
          </p>

          <h3>Liability for links</h3>
          <p>
            Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on
            whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any
            liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
            operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the
            linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
            violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not
            recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of
            the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
            evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware of any legal
            infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
          </p>

          <h3>Copyright</h3>
          <p>
            The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages
            are subject to German copyright law. The duplication, processing,
            distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of
            copyright law require the written consent of the respective author
            or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for
            private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was
            not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are
            respected. In particular, third-party content is identified as such.
            Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement,
            please inform us accordingly. If we become aware of any
            infringements, we will remove such content immediately.
          </p>

          <h3>Data protection</h3>
          <p>
            The use of our website is usually possible without providing
            personal data. As far as personal data (e.g., name, address, or
            email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a
            voluntary basis as far as possible. This data will not be passed on
            to third parties without your express consent.<br />
            We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet
            (e.g., communication by email) can have security gaps. A complete
            protection of data against access by third parties is not
            possible.<br />
            The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint
            obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and
            information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators
            of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the
            event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as
            spam emails.
